## Writing a new Notification

LinchPin Notifications have a few components:
* A commands.json file that lists and describes the `commands` the notification supports
* A notification.json file that describes the notification, gives it a logo, and adds it to our app for users to choose.

### Commands.json file

Example commands.json configuration file:
{% gist 9cb479365e50e1003ed4 %}
<div class="alert alert-danger"><b>Warning!</b> Including an id will replace default behavior. </div>
